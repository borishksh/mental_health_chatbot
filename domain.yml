          Sit quietly with your feet on the floor, or lie down, and relax your body. Begin with some slow, diaphragmatic breathing. Focus your mind on your breath as it flows in and out of your nostrils. Continue to follow your breath to whatever extent you can.
          
          As you breathe, notice the tendency of the mind to wander. Instead of trying to focus just on the breath, just notice what the mind does. It may wander to a worry, or a memory, or to what you plan to do later today. You may notice sensations in your body, such as a pain or itch. You may hear or smell things.
          
          Just notice whatever happens and then gently bring yourself back to your breath. You can remind yourself that you will tend to these other things later, and for now you will just spend time paying attention to your breath and to your mind.

          Allow the mind to wander as it will, time after time. Avoid the tendency to try hard to focus on something. Simply allow your mind to wander and then bring yourself back to your breath. Notice the tendency of your experience to change. Imagine that each thought, sensation, emotion—anything— is like a cloud floating through the sky, soon to be replaced by another one.  

          Continue to practice this for about 10 minutes. Depending on your schedule you can add time to your practice if you want. Practice once or twice a day.

          PMR involves doing this with each group of muscles in the body, as a regularly practiced exercise that takes effect over a period of time. 

          This will take you about 16 minutes.
